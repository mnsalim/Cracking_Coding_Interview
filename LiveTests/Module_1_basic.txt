Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer 'n'.

The factorial of a non-negative integer 'n' is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'. It is denoted by 'n!' and defined as follows:

0! = 1

n! = n * (n-1)! for n > 0

In this problem, you need to implement the factorial function and calculate the factorial of the given non-negative integer 'n'. Consider both the time complexity and space complexity of your solution.

Hint: You can use an iterative approach to solve this problem. Think about the time complexity of the loop and whether there is any additional space used to store variables during the calculation.
