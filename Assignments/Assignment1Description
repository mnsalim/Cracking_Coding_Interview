Assignment on Introduction
Assignment:

Write a function to calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers.


In this problem, you need to implement the sum_of_natural_numbers function and calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers. The function should take an integer n as input and return the sum of the numbers from 1 to N.
Make sure to consider both the time complexity (how long it takes to run the function) and the space complexity (how much memory is used) in your solution.
Hint: You can use a simple loop to add the numbers from 1 to N iteratively. Think about the time complexity of the loop and whether there is any additional space used to store variables during the calculation.

Submission Guideline: 
You can upload the code (using c++ or Javascript) in a doc. 
Or you can share the github link.
